# ShiVa Flash Engine: XML/PHP demo
2012 demo of ShiVa Flash &lt;-> XML/PHP interaction to send high scores over the internet.

Before building these samples, please check the build .bat file for the correct paths and names. The things worth studying most are the main .as files as well as additional php/xml files, not so much the ShiVa code inside the STEs themselves.

Note that AS3<->ShiVa samples only work when you upload them to a real webserver. Opening the files locally in your browser will not show the expected results.
